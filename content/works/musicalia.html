    <h2>About the game</h2>
    <br>
    Musicalia is a 2D Pixel Art Game that fits into the categories of a RPG, Adventure Game, as well as a Music
    Rythm Game.
    The game focuses on helping the main character, Chip, reunite a band and bring color and happiness back to the
    city of Musicalia.
    To achieve that goal, the player must solve a series of puzzles to find each band member and convince them to
    get back together.
