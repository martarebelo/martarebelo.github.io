        <br>
        <h1>Musicalia</h1>



        Project developed in the curricular unit of Digital Games, as part of the Multimedia Master's degree. The game
        is currently hosted on itch.io at <a

        <h2>About the game</h2>

        Musicalia is a 2D Pixel Art Game that fits into the categories of a RPG, Adventure Game, as well as a Music
        Rythm
        Game.
        The game focuses on helping the main character, Chip, reunite a band and bring color and happiness backto the
        city of Musicalia.
        To achieve that goal, the player must solve a series of puzzles to find each band member
        and convince them to
        get back together.
